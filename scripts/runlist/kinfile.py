# Script to grab info from standard.kinematics, for use in the run list shell script
# This script splits the standard.kinematics file into blocks, and loops over every line in a block. It strips out comments such that the first line is the run number range
# It finds the relevant run number range block, and gets info to feed into the run list
# It will send the info from the LAST matching block in the kinematics file

# Import relevant packages
