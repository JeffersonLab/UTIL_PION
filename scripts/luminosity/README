inputRuns                             : List of luminosity run numbers
run_batch_replay_lumi_coin_offline.sh : Batch script that calls ../replay_lumi.sh which will run a
                                        scaler replay for bcm values, a full replay, and the
					../src/lumiyield.py script
run_batch_lumi_script.sh              : Batch script that calls ../lumi_script.sh which will run
                                        only the ../src/lumiyield.py script


Source code: 
=================================
Located in src directory...

lumiyield.py                      : which applies cuts to various ROOT leaves and calculates things
                                    like tracking, HMS events, etc. This will output a csv file to
				    ../OUTPUTS/lumi_data.csv which can be imported to an excel sheet or
				    used as an input for the second Python script (plot_yield.py)
plot_yield.py                     : Reads in the values of ../OUTPUTS/lumi_data.csv and plots yields
                                    with uncertainty. These yield values, along with the values of
				    ../OUTPUTS/lumi_data.csv, are printed to an output csv file
				    ../OUTPUTS/yield_data.csv. It is suggested that this is run
				    individually with python.
replay/replay_lumi_coin_offline.C : Replay script that calls config files...
                                    DBASE/COIN/standard_Offline.database, MAPS/COIN/DETEC/coin.map
				    MAPS/db_cratemap.dat,
				    UTIL_KAONLT/config/DEF-files/luminosity_coin.def,
				    UTIL_KAONLT/config/DEF-files/luminosity_coin_cuts.def,
				    UTIL_KAONLT/config/TEMPLATES/lumi_coin.template
python/root2py                    : Custom script developed by Richard Trotta for easier binning of
                                    histograms in MatPlotlib python package plus some other fun
				    features. Don't edit unless you know what you're doing!


How to run: 
=================================

replay_lumi.sh <runNumber> <numEvents>  : Calls scaler replay
                                          SCRIPTS/COIN/SCALERS/replay_coin_scalers.C, full replay
                                          ../src/replay/replay_lumi_coin_offline.C, and lumi analysis
					  script ../src/lumiyield.py
lumi_script.sh  <runNumber> <numEvents> : Calls just lumi analysis script ../src/lumiyield.py
