DONE- Scripts in this directory still need testing
DONE- Replays for HeeP runs should output to ROOTfiles/Analysis/HeeP, NOT Analysis/PionLT, minor fix we can do later
- Plotting script should not splash anything to screen in terms of plots, it should execute, make the pdf and THEN display the pdf using an evince command in the shell script
- Need to adjust fit so that it is heep specific
